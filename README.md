# FaceGAN
We feed in Images of More than 100,000 Faces from the CelebFaces Attributes Data Set to the Discriminator of the GAN .The Generator creates Images from a Latent 1-D Vector.It tries to red-create Realistic Images so as to "fool" the Discriminator into believing its a Real Image.

We feed in Semi Complete Images of Suspects .Our GAN Structure completes it to Provide a Comprehensive Image of the Perpetuator.
